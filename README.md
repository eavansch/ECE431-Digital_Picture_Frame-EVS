# ECE431-Digital_Picture_Frame-EVS
Final project for ECE 431 - Microcontrollers at Kansas State University

Implemented using the MSP430FR6989 Launchpad board as well as the MSP430FR6989 Boosterpack board

Project is an implementation of a digital photo frame holding 5 separate pictures. Images have been converted using Texas Instrument's Image Reformer software down to 128x128 imnages. Images are controlled by use of the ADC joystick.
Also contains a landing screen containing information on how to navigate the frame. Images are included as .c files, and are called from main.c.
